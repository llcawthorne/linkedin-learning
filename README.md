# linkedin-learning 

This is just a place to store various work I did while going through
courses in Linked-In Learning.  I got a 90 day trial to Linked-In
Learning, so I watched a variety of courses.  Notably, I spent
most of Christmas break learning about Spring.  

Right now the only directory is the Spring directory, but I'll
add some other topics as the 90 days goes on.

These used to all be separate repositories.  I realized the
individual commits to the repositories were mostly uninteresting,
so I made one linkedin-learning repository to contain my coursework
from Linked-In Learning courses.  The repositories were adding up
too quick, since these courses are only a couple of hours each,
and I'ld probably rather checkout at least all the ones on a given 
topic if I was trying to remember how to do something (arguable).
