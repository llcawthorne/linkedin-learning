# linkedin-learning-spring-security

This is just where I'm working the exercises for the
LinkedIn Learning Course on Spring Security
<https://www.linkedin.com/learning/spring-spring-security/>.

Overall, it was a pretty good course.  Probably one of the
more valuable of the courses offered by LinkedIn Learning
on the topic of Spring.  I wish the examples
of LDAP Authentication went more into how to do it with
Active Directory, but that's just something I'll have to
lookup to get working.
